1) server doesn't always successfully connect to its uplink on the first try.
   It seems it sends something to the uplink to cause the uplink to send back
   ERROR, and the server disconnects and retries on next auto-conn interval.
   Or...  something like that, anyway...

2) Server likes to core more often when connected to hybrid/ratbox servers.

3) server cores shortly after a server is unjuped?  or does it core because
   of a reload of the config?

4) Anyone with a login can unjupe a server.  There's no checks in the unjupe
   code to make sure that 5 opers or 3 admins approve.  Also, it may be
   possible to just /squit a jupe as well.  I see no flag being set on the
   juped client struct to say it is a 'reconnecting' jupe.  Needs testing.

5) kills sent from the chanjupe and uhjupe modules don't remove the client
   from memory.  Those modules were meant as temporary solution against
   drones, anyway.  They've not been voted in and they are certainly not
   code-complete.

6) Various things like /whois aren't finished. :)

7) DBs are not portable between different endian type machines.
