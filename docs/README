This is the code for a modular IRC services daemon.  It is compatable with
current EFNet IRC servers.

To build:

You'll need a copy of libcsconfig-1.0 and libnnmatch-1.0.

1) mkdir build-services
2) cd build-services
3) extract csconfig into 'csconfig-1.0' directory
4) extract nnmatch to 'nnmatch-1.0' directory
5) extract services source to 'services-*' directory
6) cd csconfig-1.0 && make
7) cd nnmatch-1.0 && make
8) cd services-* && ./configure && make

The 'services' binary will be located in the services-*/daemon dir.

At some point, I'll fix 'services' to use the newest versions of 'csconfig'
and 'nnmatch' (or equiv)...which install themselves into /usr/local/lib,
thus making the above a little less painful.

Enjoy.
