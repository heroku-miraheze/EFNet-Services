-- need to add hostname and maybe info len checks to clients that
     get added from modules...

-- chanfix callback changes modes of channels and clients, etc, but
     no other modules get those changes via callbacks.  fix this..
     maybe by forcing mode changes, etc, having to go thru module
     functions.

-- write real logging functions for the modules which will log
     module name, then string.

-- change command callback stuff to be able to return errors so
     that the main parser can log the error with the full command
     name, cached before the the command separates the args.

-- admin module needs to be a login module, allowing other modules
     to create flags to give to logins, etc...
     admin status will be a flag.
